# Tracking-Bird-Migration

The Bird Migration Tracking Project aims to  analyze the migration patterns of various bird species. By using GPS tracking and data analytics, we hope to gain insights into the migratory routes, stopover sites, and the impact of environmental factors on bird migration. This project combines field data collection with advanced data analysis techniques to contribute to ornithological research and conservation efforts.


Software: Python
->  numpy for numerical operations

->  pandas for data manipulation

->  matplotlib for data visualization

Methodology

Data Collection:

-> Gather data on bird species, GPS coordinates, timestamps, and environmental conditions.

-> Store the collected data in CSV format.

Data Analysis:

-> Use numpy and pandas for data manipulation and analysis.

-> Utilize matplotlib for data visualization.

-> Perform statistical analysis to identify migration patterns and trends.
